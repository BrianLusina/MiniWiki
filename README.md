# Wiki-Page

Objective of this Wiki-Page is to build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/). 

The site allows a user to search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries without searching for the same on Google. The user also has an option to obtain a random Wikipedia entry. This is possible using this [*special*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) link. The Wikipedia API used: [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
