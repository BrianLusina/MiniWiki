# Mini Wiki

A simple and small wikipedia search built on JavaScript.

The site allows a user to search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries without searching for the same on Google. The user also has an option to obtain a random Wikipedia entry. This is possible using this [*special*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) link. The Wikipedia API used: [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)

There are two versions for the app 1 made in ReactJS and another in plain jQuery:

Apps can be found here:

1. [jQuery version](http://mini-wiki.bitballoon.com/)
2. [ReactJS version](https://miniwikiview.herokuapp.com/)

To get the ReactJS version:

Simply clone the repo:
``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BrianLusina/Wiki-Page.git
```
Install dependencies with npm
``` sh
$ npm install
```

That's it. Have fun
